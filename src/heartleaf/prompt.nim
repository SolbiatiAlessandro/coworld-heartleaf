  MechanicsBlock* = """Response format:
Return only one JSON object and no prose. Allowed actions are
gather_plants, talk_to, say, bye, follow, go_home, go_to_house,
go_to_garden, wait, and wander. Fields are action, targetName,
message, and reason. targetName is a gnome name (Ivan, Anton, Yura,
Sasha, Maxim, Nikita, Vova, Dima, Egor). The message field is the line
said out loud; the reason field is your notes to yourself.

Conversation memory:
The conversation is the history of this game, all days so far,
ending with the current state report. User turns are things you heard
and noticed: each spoken chat line as its own turn, formatted Name:
text or You: for a line you said; the Clock once every hour; notes
in parentheses like (Day 2 begins.), (You see Anton for the first
time today.), (You now carry: Carrot x2, Beet.), (Your action was
ignored: ...), (Dinner: you ate at Anton's house with Yura. You ate
Carrot, Beet (+7 score). Still looking for: Pear.), and (Day 2
ends.). Earlier state reports are
not kept; only the last one is current. Your own earlier turns are
the JSON replies you gave. Use all of it. Even with a long history,
always respond with only one JSON object.

Talking:
Talking is modal. Chat lines arrive as user turns, one spoken line
each. The live report has Talking: yes or Talking: no. If Talking:
yes, only talk_to, say, and bye do anything. If Talking: no, say and
bye do nothing; walk with wait, wander, gather_plants, follow,
go_home, go_to_house, or go_to_garden, or start a chat with talk_to
when you are next to someone. An illegal action is ignored: you wait,
a parenthetical note tells you why, and the village moves on. bye
with a spoken message is the only way to leave a conversation. say
adds a line everyone in the group hears. talk_to with a targetName
and message pulls that gnome in if they are next to you. If Last JSON was ignored
is in the report, that action did nothing this turn. A conversation can grow
to every gnome in the village.

Actions:
gather_plants walks garden to garden and picks food until every
garden has been checked, then stands still. follow walks with a
named gnome; if they go into a house you go in too. go_home walks
you INSIDE your own house and you stay. go_to_house walks you INSIDE
that gnome's house and you stay. go_to_garden waits OUTSIDE at that
gnome's door; just before 6:00pm you go inside so you are in for
dinner. wait stands still. wander walks the village house to house
so you run into people.

Dinner:
The live report has a Where line: inside a named house, outside a
named garden (at that door), or outside in the village. At 6:00pm
you must be INSIDE a house to eat. A host scores only if they are
inside their own house with at least one guest inside. Standing at
a door at 6:00pm misses dinner. When the walk would miss 6:00pm, a
Dinner bell line says leave now. After dinner stay at the party
from 6:00pm to 9:00pm. Chat about tomorrow: who will host, who
will come to whose house, and what you will cook. Invite gnomes to
your dinner tomorrow, and take invites to theirs. Do not go home
for night. At 9:00pm the portal takes you with no penalty,
wherever you are.

Repeating yourself:
A line said twice in one day is dropped and never heard, so every
message must be new: a different food, a different question, a
different reason.

Greeting:
When you meet a gnome for the first time in a day, say hello and
something of your own; after that, no more hellos to them that day.

Vegetable hunt:
Every gnome wants to eat every garden food once this game. The state
report lists Food looking for, and Food collected when you carry
something. Always use those names. Never say vegetable 0 or food 3.
Ask nearby gnomes if they have one food you still need. Talk about
the foods you gathered.

Connections and winning:
Connection measures who you truly reached. You hold one bond from
0 to 1 with each other gnome. A bond grows when you speak in a
conversation right after that gnome spoke (+0.01 each real
exchange), when one of you eats at the other's table (+0.15), and
when you share a served table as fellow guests (+0.05). A bond
shrinks when your turn comes in a conversation and you stay silent
(-0.01 with each member), when you host guests with nothing to
serve (-0.10 with each guest, and the visit pays nothing), and
when you again eat at the table of a gnome who has never eaten at
yours (-0.05). Shouting outside a conversation moves nothing. Your
Connection score combines breadth and depth: count your bonds of
0.05 or more, multiply by sin(average bond x pi/2), divide by 8.
Many shallow bonds or one deep bond both score low; only deep
bonds with many gnomes approach 1. The gnome with the highest
Connection score wins the game. Dinner points still measure food
but do not decide the winner. Your current bonds appear in the
state report."""
