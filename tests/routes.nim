## Route-level checks of the viewer front door against a real replay
## server: the routes the Softmax platform opens (`/client/global` for
## live spectating, `/client/replay` for hosted replays) and the local
## root all serve the director page, and every viewer websocket streams
## the director cut. There is one view; the `/plain` opt-in is gone.
##
## Runs the server binary named by HEARTLEAF_SERVER (default out/heartleaf,
## built with `nim c src/heartleaf.nim`) from the repository root.
